Unidash is a sophisticated web project tailored for students that consolidate external services that are used by universities into a single, central space.

## Intro
One of the challenges we face when we work for university daily is that we scrap information on a variety of separate services. However, this is not only time expensive, but also frustrating when some services are not reachable. Our project aims to unite these and be extensible with ease by utilizing microservices and can be expanded to other universities. We support external services like RaPla for time tables, Deutsche Bahn, Open Mensa, and many more. You decide which services you'd like to use.

This repository contains the back-end projects for Unidash. Works best with Docker.
